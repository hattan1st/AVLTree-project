# AVL Tree (Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree)

This project demonstrates how an AVL Tree works using Java

> 💡 **Note:** This project was developed as part of my academic coursework in the Computer Science program.


## 📌 Features
- Insert nodes dynamically
- Auto-balance using rotations
- Track tree height and balance factor
- Sample test with printed output

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Tree height calculation
- Balance Factor logic
- Left / Right Rotations
- O(log n) time complexity

## 🔍 Sample Output
```java
Inserting 10, 20, 30...
Rotation triggered (Left-Left)
Balance Factor = 0
